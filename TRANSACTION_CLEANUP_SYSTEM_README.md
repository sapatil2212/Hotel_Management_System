# üßπ Transaction Cleanup System

## üìã Overview

The HMS (Hotel Management System) now includes a comprehensive **Transaction Cleanup System** that ensures when bookings, invoices, or payments are deleted, all related transactions in the account management system are automatically deleted as well. This maintains data integrity and prevents orphaned transaction records.

## üéØ **Problem Solved**

### **Previous Issue**
- When bookings, bills, or invoices were deleted, the corresponding transactions in the account management system remained
- This caused discrepancies between the actual financial data and what was displayed in the account management
- Users would see credited amounts even after the source booking/invoice was deleted

### **Solution Implemented**
- **Automatic Transaction Cleanup**: All related transactions are deleted when their source records are deleted
- **Complete Data Integrity**: No orphaned transactions remain in the system
- **Real-time Balance Updates**: Account balances are immediately corrected

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Enhanced Booking Deletion API** (`app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`)
   - Deletes all transactions related to the booking
   - Deletes all transactions related to the booking's invoices
   - Deletes all transactions related to the booking's payments
   - Reverses revenue and updates account balances

2. **Enhanced Invoice Deletion API** (`app/api/invoices/[id]/route.ts`)
   - Deletes all transactions related to the invoice
   - Deletes all transactions related to the invoice's payments
   - Reverses revenue and updates account balances

3. **Enhanced Payment Deletion API** (`app/api/payments/[id]/route.ts`)
   - Deletes all transactions related to the payment
   - Reverses revenue and updates account balances

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Transaction Types Handled**

The system handles three types of transaction references:

1. **Booking Transactions** (`referenceType: 'booking'`)
   - Created when revenue is added to accounts for a booking
   - Deleted when the booking is deleted

2. **Invoice Transactions** (`referenceType: 'invoice'`)
   - Created when invoices are generated
   - Deleted when the invoice is deleted

3. **Payment Transactions** (`referenceType: 'payment'`)
   - Created when payments are processed
   - Deleted when the payment is deleted

### **Database Schema**

```sql
model transaction {
  id                String             @id @default(cuid())
  accountId         String
  type              transaction_type
  category          transaction_category
  amount            Float
  description       String
  referenceId       String?            // Reference to booking/invoice/payment ID
  referenceType     reference_type?    // booking, invoice, payment, etc.
  paymentMethod     payment_method?
  processedBy       String?
  notes             String?            @db.Text
  transactionDate   DateTime           @default(now())
  createdAt         DateTime           @default(now())
  updatedAt         DateTime           @updatedAt
  isModification    Boolean            @default(false)
  originalAmount    Float?
  modificationReason String?           @db.Text
  account           bank_account       @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### **API Endpoints Updated**

#### **Booking Deletion**
```typescript
DELETE /api/bookings/[id]
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = booking.id` and `referenceType = 'booking'`
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = invoice.id` and `referenceType = 'invoice'` for all invoices of the booking
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = payment.id` and `referenceType = 'payment'` for all payments of the booking
- Reverses revenue using `RevenueHooks.onPaymentReversed()`
- Updates account balances

#### **Invoice Deletion**
```typescript
DELETE /api/invoices/[id]
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = invoice.id` and `referenceType = 'invoice'`
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = payment.id` and `referenceType = 'payment'` for all payments of the invoice
- Reverses revenue using `RevenueHooks.onPaymentReversed()`
- Updates account balances

#### **Payment Deletion**
```typescript
DELETE /api/payments/[id]
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes all transactions with `referenceId = payment.id` and `referenceType = 'payment'`
