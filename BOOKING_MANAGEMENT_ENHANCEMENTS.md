## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Pricing Recalculation
- **Trigger**: Date changes (check-in/check-out) automatically trigger pricing recalculation
- **Real-time Updates**: Pricing preview is shown immediately when dates are modified
- **Tax Calculation**: Includes proper tax calculations based on hotel configuration
- **Discount Preservation**: Existing discounts are preserved during recalculation

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

#### Stay Details Section
- **Editable Date Fields**: Check-in and check-out dates are clearly editable
- **Nights Display**: Shows current nights with change indicator
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue highlighted box when dates change
- **Informational Text**: Clear messaging about automatic pricing recalculation

#### Pricing Preview Section
- **Current vs New Comparison**: Side-by-side display of current and new pricing
- **Date Change Indicator**: Special icon and styling for date-based changes
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows rate per night, base amount, taxes, and total
- **Price Change Highlight**: Color-coded price difference (green for increase, red for decrease)

### 3. Backend Enhancements

#### API Improvements
- **Automatic Detection**: API detects when pricing recalculation is needed
- **Tax Integration**: Proper integration with hotel tax configuration
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all pricing fields are updated correctly
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for pricing calculations

#### Database Updates

- **Audit Trail**: Maintains updated timestamp for tracking changes
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistency between pricing components

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### `components/dashboard/bookings-table.tsx`
- **Enhanced `handleDateChange`**: Triggers pricing calculation on date changes
- **Improved Pricing Preview**: Better visual presentation of pricing changes
- **Success Messages**: Detailed success messages with pricing information
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows recently updated bookings in the table

#### Key Functions:
```typescript
// Enhanced date change handler
const handleDateChange = (field: 'checkIn' | 'checkOut', value: string) => {
  // Recalculate nights
  const newNights = calculateNights(checkIn, checkOut)
  
  // Always calculate pricing preview for date changes
  calculatePricingPreview(
    currentRoomType.price, 
    newNights, 
    originalAmount,
    discountAmount
  )
}

// Enhanced pricing preview calculation
const calculatePricingPreview = async (price, nights, originalAmount, discountAmount) => {
  // Calculate new base amount
  const newBaseAmount = price * nights
  
  // Apply existing discount percentage
  const discountPercentage = (discountAmount / originalAmount) * 100
  const newDiscountAmount = (newBaseAmount * discountPercentage) / 100
  
  // Calculate taxes
  const taxBreakdown = await calculateTaxes(newBaseAmount - newDiscountAmount)
  
  // Return complete pricing preview
}
```

### Backend API

#### `app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`
- **Enhanced PUT Endpoint**: Automatically recalculates pricing when needed
- **Tax Integration**: Uses hotel tax configuration for accurate calculations
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all pricing fields are properly updated

#### Key Logic:
```typescript
// Check if pricing needs recalculation
const needsPricingRecalculation = recalculatePricing || 
  updateData.nights !== originalBooking.nights ||
  updateData.roomTypeId !== originalBooking.room.roomType.id;

// Recalculate pricing if needed
if (needsPricingRecalculation) {
  const baseAmount = roomType.price * nights;
  const taxBreakdown = calculateTaxes(baseAmount, taxConfig);
  
  finalUpdateData = {
    ...updateData,
    originalAmount: baseAmount,
    baseAmount: taxBreakdown.baseAmount,
    totalTaxAmount: taxBreakdown.totalTaxAmount,
    totalAmount: taxBreakdown.totalAmount,
    discountAmount: originalBooking.discountAmount || 0
  };
}
```

- **Database Errors**: Proper error responses for database issues

## Configuration

### Tax Settings
The system uses hotel tax configuration from the database:
- GST percentage
- Service tax percentage
- Other taxes
- Tax enabled/disabled flag

### Pricing Logic
- **Base Amount**: Room rate × number of nights
- **Discount**: Preserves existing discount percentage
- **Taxes**: Calculated on amount after discount
- **Total**: Base amount + taxes

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Date Extension
- **Scenario**: Extend checkout date by 2 days
- **Expected**: Nights increase, total amount increases proportionally
- **Verification**: Pricing preview shows correct calculation

### 2. Date Reduction
- **Scenario**: Reduce checkout date by 1 day
- **Expected**: Nights decrease, total amount decreases proportionally
- **Verification**: Pricing preview shows correct calculation

### 3. Room Type Change
- **Scenario**: Change room type with different rate
- **Expected**: Pricing recalculates with new room rate
- **Verification**: All pricing components update correctly

### 4. Tax Configuration
- **Scenario**: Hotel has GST and service tax enabled
- **Expected**: Taxes are calculated and included in total
- **Verification**: Tax breakdown is displayed correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Support for seasonal or demand-based pricing
2. **Discount Rules**: More sophisticated discount application logic
3. **Currency Support**: Multi-currency pricing support
4. **Audit Logging**: Detailed change history for pricing updates
