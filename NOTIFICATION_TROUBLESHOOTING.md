## üß™ **Manual Testing Scripts**

### **Test Basic Notification System**
```bash
node scripts/test-notifications.js
```

### **Test Booking Notifications**
```bash
node scripts/test-booking-notification.js
```

### **Add Sample Notifications**
```bash
node scripts/seed-notifications.js
```

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **If Notifications Don't Appear:**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

2. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - Check for any error messages

3. **Verify Database**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-notifications.js
   ```

4. **Check Authentication**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check if the session is valid

5. **Check API Endpoints**
   - Test `/api/notifications` directly
   - Verify the response format

### **If Red Dot Doesn't Update:**

1. **Refresh the Page**
   - Sometimes the UI needs a refresh

2. **Check Network Connectivity**
   - Verify API calls are successful

3. **Check Polling**
   - Notifications poll every 30 seconds
   - Wait for the next poll cycle

### **If Duplicate Notifications:**

1. **Check API Calls**
   - Look for duplicate requests in Network tab

2. **Check Database**
   - Verify no duplicate records exist

## üìä **Current Status**

### **‚úÖ Working Components:**
- Database schema and migrations
- Notification service layer
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Notification bell component
- Real-time polling (30-second intervals)
- Mark as read functionality

   - Mark it as read
   - Delete it

2. **Test All Operations**
   - Payments
   - Expenses
   - Invoices
   - System notifications

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check if 30-second polling is appropriate
   - Monitor database performance

## üìû **Support**
