1. **Only bookings with invoices** are shown in revenue tracking
2. **Revenue entries are automatically deleted** when invoices are deleted
3. **Clean revenue data** with no orphaned entries

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîç **Smart Revenue Filtering**
- **Invoice-Based Display**: Only shows revenue for bookings that have invoices/bills generated
- **Clean Interface**: Hides bookings without invoices to avoid confusion
- **Clear Messaging**: Shows helpful message when no invoices exist

### üóëÔ∏è **Automatic Revenue Deletion**
- **Invoice Deletion**: When invoices are deleted, all related revenue entries are automatically removed
- **Complete Cleanup**: Removes revenue from daily, monthly, and yearly reports
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete audit trail for all deletions

### üìä **Enhanced Revenue Tracking**
- **Accurate Data**: Only tracks revenue for actual billable items
- **Real-time Updates**: Revenue disappears immediately when invoices are deleted
- **Category-wise Deletion**: Properly removes revenue from all service categories

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### **Core Components**

1. **Enhanced Revenue Status API** (`app/api/revenue/status/route.ts`)
   - Checks if booking has invoices
   - Returns `hasInvoices` flag
   - Filters out bookings without bills

2. **Revenue Tracking Dashboard** (`components/dashboard/revenue-tracking-dashboard.tsx`)
   - Only displays bookings with invoices
   - Shows helpful message for empty state
   - Real-time filtering

3. **Revenue Hooks** (`lib/revenue-hooks.ts`)
   - `deleteRevenueForBooking()` method
   - Complete revenue cleanup
   - Multi-period deletion

4. **Invoice Deletion API** (`app/api/invoices/[id]/route.ts`)
   - Calls revenue deletion on invoice removal
   - Automatic cleanup process

## üîÑ **Workflow**

### **Revenue Display Process**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Fetch All Bookings] --> B[Check Each Booking]
    B --> C{Has Invoices?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Include in Revenue Display]
    C -->|No| E[Filter Out]
    D --> F[Show Revenue Details]
    E --> G[Skip This Booking]
    F --> H[Display in Dashboard]
    G --> H
```

### **Invoice Deletion Process**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Deletes Invoice] --> B[Calculate Total Payments]
    B --> C{Payments Exist?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Reverse Payment Revenue]
    C -->|No| E[Skip Payment Reversal]
    D --> F[Delete All Revenue Entries]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Update Revenue Reports]
    G --> H[Update Booking Status]
    H --> I[Create Audit Log]
    I --> J[Dashboard Updated]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Revenue Status API Enhancement**

```typescript
// Check if booking has any invoices/bills generated
const hasInvoices = booking.invoices.length > 0;

return NextResponse.json({
  bookingId,
  guestName: booking.guestName,
  totalAmount: booking.totalAmount,
  totalPaid,
  remainingAmount,
  paymentStatus: booking.paymentStatus,
  revenueStatus,
  recentPayments: booking.payments.slice(0, 5),
  checkIn: booking.checkIn,
  checkOut: booking.checkOut,
  hasInvoices, // New flag to indicate if invoices exist
});
```

### **Revenue Dashboard Filtering**

```typescript
// Only include bookings that have invoices/bills generated
const revenueData = await revenueResponse.json();
return revenueData.hasInvoices ? revenueData : null;
```

### **Revenue Deletion Method**

```typescript
static async deleteRevenueForBooking(bookingId: string) {
  // Get booking with bill items
  const booking = await prisma.booking.findUnique({
    where: { id: bookingId },
    include: {
      billItems: {
        include: { service: true },
      },
    },
  });

  // Calculate total amount to delete from each category
  const totalAmount = booking.billItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.amount, 0);
  const categoryAmounts = this.calculateCategoryAmounts(booking, totalAmount);

  // Delete from all revenue reports
  await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(booking.checkIn, 'daily', categoryAmounts);
  await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(booking.checkIn, 'monthly', categoryAmounts);
  await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(booking.checkIn, 'yearly', categoryAmounts);
}
```

### **Invoice Deletion Integration**

```typescript
// Delete all revenue entries for this booking since invoices are being deleted
console.log(`üóëÔ∏è Deleting all revenue entries for booking ${booking.id}`);
await RevenueHooks.deleteRevenueForBooking(booking.id);
```
