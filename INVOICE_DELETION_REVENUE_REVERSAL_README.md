## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints**

```typescript
// Delete Invoice with Revenue Reversal
DELETE /api/invoices/[id]
{
  "reason": "Invoice cancellation",
  "processedBy": "Admin"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Invoice deleted successfully",
  "reversedAmount": 5000,
  "newPaymentStatus": "pending"
}
```

### **Revenue Reversal Logic**

```typescript
// Calculate total payments for the invoice
const totalPayments = invoice.payments.reduce((sum, payment) => sum + payment.amount, 0);

// If there were payments, reverse the revenue
if (totalPayments > 0) {
  console.log(`üí∞ Reversing revenue for deleted invoice: ${totalPayments} for booking ${booking.id}`);
  await RevenueHooks.onPaymentReversed(booking.id, totalPayments);
}
```

### **Audit Trail**

```typescript
// Create audit log for invoice deletion
await prisma.transaction.create({
  data: {
    type: 'debit',
    category: 'refunds',
    amount: totalPayments,
    description: `Invoice deletion: ${reason}`,
    referenceId: booking.id,
    referenceType: 'booking',
    processedBy: processedBy || session.user?.name || 'System',
    notes: `Deleted invoice of ${invoiceAmount} with ${totalPayments} in payments for booking ${booking.id}. Reason: ${reason}`,
    isModification: true,
    originalAmount: totalPayments,
    modificationReason: reason,
  },
});
```
