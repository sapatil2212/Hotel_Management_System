# 🚀 Revenue Tracking Dashboard Fixes

## 📋 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Recent Payments Display Issue**
**Problem**: The Revenue Tracking Dashboard was showing multiple recent payments that didn't align with the invoice amount, causing confusion.

**Root Cause**: The payment deduplication logic was too strict (only checking within 1 minute) and didn't properly handle split payments or multiple payment scenarios.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced payment deduplication logic in `app/api/revenue/status/route.ts`
- Increased time tolerance from 1 minute to 5 minutes for better payment grouping
- Added logic to detect split payments (multiple payments that sum up to invoice amount)
- Limited display to 3 most recent unique payments instead of 5
- Added payment summary section for multiple payments

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced deduplication logic
const isDuplicate = acc.find(p => {
  const timeDiff = Math.abs(new Date(p.paymentDate).getTime() - new Date(payment.paymentDate).getTime());
  const isTimeClose = timeDiff < 300000; // 5 minutes instead of 1 minute
  
  // Check duplicate payments
  const isDuplicatePayment = p.amount === payment.amount && 
                           p.paymentMethod === payment.paymentMethod && 
                           isTimeClose;
  
  // Check split payments
  const isSplitPayment = p.paymentMethod === payment.paymentMethod && 
                       isTimeClose && 
                       Math.abs((p.amount + payment.amount) - actualBillableAmount) < 1;
  
  return isDuplicatePayment || isSplitPayment;
});
```

### 2. **Revenue Not Automatically Deleted on Invoice Deletion**
**Problem**: When bills/invoices were deleted from the Billing & Invoice Management section, related revenue was not automatically removed from the Revenue Tracking Dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The revenue deletion process was not comprehensive enough and didn't handle all revenue tracking records.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `deleteRevenueForBooking()` method in `lib/revenue-hooks.ts`
- Added comprehensive revenue deletion from daily, monthly, and yearly reports
- Added deletion of revenue tracking records and update logs
- Improved error handling to ensure invoice deletion continues even if revenue deletion fails
- Added better logging for audit trail

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced revenue deletion
static async deleteRevenueForBooking(bookingId: string) {
  // Delete from all relevant dates (payment dates or check-in date)
  if (booking.payments.length > 0) {
    for (const payment of booking.payments) {
      await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(payment.paymentDate, 'daily', categoryAmounts);
      await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(payment.paymentDate, 'monthly', categoryAmounts);
      await this.deleteFromRevenueReport(payment.paymentDate, 'yearly', categoryAmounts);
    }
  }
  
  // Delete revenue tracking records
  await this.deleteRevenueTrackingRecords(bookingId);
}
```

### 3. **Dashboard Refresh and Real-time Updates**
**Problem**: The Revenue Tracking Dashboard didn't automatically refresh to show updated data after invoice deletions.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Enhanced manual refresh functionality with better error handling
- Added notification system to inform users about automatic updates
- Improved loading states and user feedback

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchRevenueData();
  
  // Set up periodic refresh every 30 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchRevenueData();
  }, 30000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```
