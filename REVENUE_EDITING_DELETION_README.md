## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **API Endpoints**

```typescript
// Update Payment
PUT /api/payments/[id]
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "paymentMethod": "card",
  "notes": "Payment adjustment",
  "reason": "Revenue adjustment"
}

// Delete Payment
DELETE /api/payments/[id]
{
  "reason": "Revenue reversal",
  "processedBy": "Admin"
}
```

### **Revenue Adjustment Logic**

```typescript
// Calculate amount difference
const amountDifference = newAmount - originalAmount;

if (amountDifference > 0) {
  // Amount increased - add to revenue
  await RevenueHooks.onPaymentCompleted(bookingId, amountDifference);
} else if (amountDifference < 0) {
  // Amount decreased - reverse revenue
  await RevenueHooks.onPaymentReversed(bookingId, Math.abs(amountDifference));
}
```

### **Audit Trail**

```typescript
// Create audit log for modifications
await prisma.transaction.create({
  data: {
    type: amountDifference > 0 ? 'credit' : 'debit',
    category: 'payment_modification',
    amount: Math.abs(amountDifference),
    description: `Payment modification: ${reason}`,
    isModification: true,
    originalAmount: originalAmount,
    modificationReason: reason,
  },
});
```
