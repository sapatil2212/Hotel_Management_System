# Duplicate Payments Fix

## Issue Description

The Revenue Tracking Dashboard was showing duplicate payments for the same transaction. This was happening because:

1. **Invoice creation with 'paid' status** automatically creates a payment record
2. **Separate payment recording** through billing management creates another payment record
3. **Result**: Duplicate payments showing in the revenue tracking dashboard

## Root Cause

The duplicate payments were being created in multiple places:

- `app/api/invoices/route.ts` - When creating invoices with status 'paid'
- `app/api/payments/route.ts` - When recording payments separately
- `lib/billing-service.ts` - When processing payments through the billing service
- `lib/invoice-service.ts` - When recording payments through the invoice service

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update

Added a unique constraint to prevent duplicate payments at the database level:

```prisma
model payment {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  @@unique([bookingId, amount, paymentMethod, paymentDate], map: "unique_booking_payment")
}
```

### 2. Application-Level Duplicate Prevention

Added duplicate checking in all payment creation methods:

- **Invoice Creation**: Check for existing payments before creating new ones
- **Payment API**: Check for duplicates within 5-minute window
- **Billing Service**: Prevent duplicate payment creation
- **Invoice Service**: Check for existing payments before recording

### 3. Enhanced Deduplication Logic

Improved the revenue status API to better detect and filter duplicate payments:

```typescript
// Check if a payment with the same amount, method, and date already exists
const isDuplicate = acc.find(p => 
  p.amount === payment.amount && 
  p.paymentMethod === payment.paymentMethod && 
  Math.abs(new Date(p.paymentDate).getTime() - new Date(payment.paymentDate).getTime()) < 60000 // Within 1 minute
);
```

### 4. Cleanup Script

Created a script to clean up existing duplicate payments:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-duplicate-payments.js
```

## Files Modified

1. **`prisma/schema.prisma`** - Added unique constraint
2. **`app/api/invoices/route.ts`** - Added duplicate checking
3. **`app/api/payments/route.ts`** - Added duplicate prevention
4. **`lib/billing-service.ts`** - Added duplicate checking
5. **`lib/invoice-service.ts`** - Added duplicate checking
6. **`app/api/revenue/status/route.ts`** - Enhanced deduplication logic
7. **`scripts/cleanup-duplicate-payments.js`** - Cleanup script for existing duplicates

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_payment_unique_constraint
```

### Step 2: Clean Up Existing Duplicates (Optional)

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-duplicate-payments.js
```

### Step 3: Restart the Application

The application will now prevent duplicate payments from being created.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Database Constraint**: Unique constraint prevents duplicate payments at the database level
2. **Application Logic**: Multiple layers of duplicate checking before payment creation
3. **Time Window**: 5-minute window to detect and prevent duplicates
4. **Audit Logging**: Console logs when duplicates are detected

## Testing

After applying the fix:

1. Create a new invoice with 'paid' status
2. Try to record a payment for the same booking
3. Verify that only one payment appears in the Revenue Tracking Dashboard
4. Check that the total revenue calculations are accurate

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates duplicate payments** in the Revenue Tracking Dashboard
- ✅ **Accurate revenue reporting** with correct totals
- ✅ **Better user experience** with clear payment information
- ✅ **Data integrity** at both application and database levels
- ✅ **Automatic prevention** of future duplicate payments

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Existing duplicate payments can be cleaned up using the provided script
- The 5-minute time window can be adjusted if needed
- All payment creation methods now have consistent duplicate prevention logic
